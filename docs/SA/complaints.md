# Complaints

The complaints section allows you to create and manage complaints or problems related to your facility. New complaints can be added by clicking the + button at the top right.

- You can still check for complaints that are open, those in progress and those already closed.

- To update a complaint, click on it and edit the details. To complete a complaint and mark it as closed, change the status you find under the corresponding entry.

Complaints with a closed status can no longer be edited.

It is mandatory to select, when creating a complaint, the room number or the reference customer together with the type of complaint. In fact, all the complaints created through the App staff will also be displayed in the Framework, under the corresponding guest profile.
