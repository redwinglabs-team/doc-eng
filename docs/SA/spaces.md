# Spaces

When you log in to the Staff App, you will be automatically directed to the Spaces section, where you will see the status of the rooms within your facility.

The name of the facility you are logged in to will appear at the top of the page. You can refresh the page using the appropriate icon to stay up to date on the status of the rooms.

- Use the filter to narrow your search. For example, a room attendant who has been assigned the first floor may want to get an update on all leaving rooms with dirty status.

Or she would like to check the rooms that were occupied the night before to clean them accordingly.

A head housekeeper would like to be able to see all the leaving rooms that have already been cleaned so that he can inspect them.

- To change the status of a camera, there are two options: you can click on a camera and update its status in the new screen, and, if you want to put a camera out of service, enter the reason and click Save. The second option is to simply swipe on the room you update wishes and select the new room status (mobile only).
