# Reservations

A second integrated section, which communicates between the Staff App and the FnB, is dedicated to table reservations in a restaurant and generic services related to the structure.

- To create a new booking, click on an outlet, select the date and the number of adults and children present (there is also a notes field to report any guest needs).

Automatically, the time slots available for booking will be displayed. Then just fill in the guest's details or room number and complete the reservation by clicking on the Create button.

- To book a service, on the other hand, click on an outlet and go to the Services section from the screen above. Add at least one item and proceed to checkout by filling in the guest details (name or room number). To complete the reservation, click on the Create button.
