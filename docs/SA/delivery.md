# Delivery

In the Staff App you will also find a section dedicated to delivery or room service. This section is integrated directly with the FnB module, and with Quadro.

- You can select the restaurant, choose the dishes from the menu and request them directly in your room at a set time. You can also check the orders placed in person by clicking on the My Order button at the top right of the screen.

- To create a new delivery order, click on a restaurant, add at least one dish from the menu to the cart and proceed to checkout the order. Select the room to deliver to and choose the time you wish to receive the order. There is also a notes field to report any further need requested by the guest.

Once the order is confirmed, the cost is charged directly to the room. Staff App sends the details of the transaction to Quadro and FnB, which is saved in the guest's account and in the accounting report.

!!! Note
    In one order, it is not possible to order dishes from different restaurants. To do this, you will need to create two different delivery orders
