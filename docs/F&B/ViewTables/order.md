# order

Use the order to send the order to the kitchen and manage the dishes inside.

The order is available on any device, from PC to smartphone. The management of the order starts from taking charge of the dish, up to the call to the next course.

## Create a new order

The order uses a racing system to facilitate the work of all the staff. The races are divided into two categories: those dedicated to food, and those dedicated to drinks.

1. Go to Main Menu> Spaces
2. Select the table you wish to take over
3. Click Add / Edit Scope
4. Add at least one dish to the Corsa
    - After adding a plate to a Race, the next Race is automatically created. Use this system to divide the order and make work in the kitchen easier. For example, you can divide the courses by course (appetizers, first courses, second courses, etc.).
5. After placing the dishes, you can submit the order:
    - Send order: process the order and send the order to the kitchen
    - Print and send order: if you have connected a printer, the system simultaneously prints the order and sends the order to the kitchen.

### detail of the fields of a plate

Adding a plate to a order is a complex action that involves a series of details to specify

- Select Chair: Select one of the table chairs to assign the dish to
- Quantity: Select the quantity of dishes to add to the order
- Center Table: Choose if the dish is shared between all the diners
- Shared with: Choose whether the pot is shared between two or more table members
- 1/2 serving: Create a half serving of the dish
- With / Without: Enter any ingredients to add or remove from the plate
- Notes: any additional notes on the dish (e.g. medium cooking, well done, etc.)

## Editing a order

Once the order has been sent, the first Race automatically changes its status to "To Do" and the ball thus passes to the kitchen that has to prepare the dishes. However, it is always possible to edit a dish within a course unless it is in the "Completed" state.

When the order is changed, the first Race having a status other than "Completed" is paused.

When the order is sent, the Corsa is no longer paused and resumes its previous state.
