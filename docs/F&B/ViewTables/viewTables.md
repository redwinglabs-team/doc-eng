# Tables Manager

The Tables Manager section is the ideal interface for managing your rooms during the Service in progress, for managing occupied tables and orders received or pending.

## Assign reservation to a table

In order to place your order at the table, you must first occupy that table. A table can be occupied either by an already made reservation or by a quick order.

Although you can choose which service to set the room for, you can only manage the room for the current day.

### Assign Reservation

Reservations for the current day are displayed in the left column of the screen. You can choose which reservations to manage thanks to the filter by Service.

!!! Note
    Assigning a reservation to a table automatically changes its status to "in processing"

1. Go to Main Menu> Spaces
2. Search for the reservation you want to assign to a table
3. Click the Add button
4. Select the table to assign the reservation to
5. Click on confirm to complete the operation

!!! Note
    You can only assign a reservation to an unoccupied table. Free tables are marked with the circle of their green number.

### Fast Order

Assigning a Quick Order to a table allows you to immediately take the order for that table. This saves time on creating the booking, but customer data will not be taken into account in the reporting section.

1. Go to Main Menu> Spaces
2. Click on an empty table
3. From the side menu, click on the Quick Order item

## Management of Tables

During a service it may happen that you have to change the layout of the room during the race. Quadro FnB responds to this need with the possibility of moving, dividing and joining the tables in a few steps.

However, any changes made are not permanent. It will reset once the ongoing service is finished.

If you have created more than one room, you can change the room displayed by the room name tabs at the top of the page.
