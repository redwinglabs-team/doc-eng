# WELCOME to Quadro Fnb!

In this guide you will find everything you need to know about Quadro FnB, the new management system for catering, an all-in-one system for managing a restaurant.

It offers the possibility for restaurateurs to manage room, kitchen and back-office operations from a single platform based on a cloud structure.

Our restaurant management system does much more than that. It helps facilities to open up to new opportunities, to follow current trends, to reduce waste, to optimize staff management, to update their menu in real time and to consolidate the loyalty of their customers.

Our systems are developed using secure and open APIs, so as to facilitate integration operations with any other third-party software. In fact, you can connect any payment gateway, online ordering platforms, delivery services, loyalty programs, booking apps and much more.

Check out our detailed documentation to find answers to any questions.
