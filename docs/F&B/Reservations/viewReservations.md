# View Reservations

The Reservations Overview allows you to view, change status, manage the Service and search for current, past and future reservations for a restaurant.

Integrated with Quadro, the two systems share information on bookers, including room number and sensitive information (eg allergies and intolerances). Payments are fully automated, and a guest's reservation can conveniently be viewed on both systems.

The booking overview offers an extensive filter system that meets any need.

## Filters
