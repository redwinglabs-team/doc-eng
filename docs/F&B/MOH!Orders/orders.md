# Orders app

The Orders App section receives orders made via the app, managing orders separately in two sections: the first for home deliveries and the second for take-away. This way you can check and change the status of your orders, view their details and even cancel them if necessary.

## Delivery

### Filters

- Date: select the date to view the results based on the chosen day
- Search: enter the name or surname of a user to search for orders placed by him
- Status: select a status to view matching orders
