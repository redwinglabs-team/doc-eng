# Inventory

Inventory organizes your facility's warehouse without losing a single item. The quantity of a product is updated in real time and, when its availability ends or is close to exhaustion, a notification system will notify you of low stock, inviting you to place a new order.

The items in the inventory are automatically imported from the Menu, respecting the division into categories.

## Change the quantity of an inventory item

If, as regards the pricing of products, this occurs automatically every time an item is ordered and paid for, the replenishment must be carried out manually.

1. Go to Main Menu> Inventory
2. Select the item whose quantity you want to update
3. Under Quantity, enter the number of items available
4. Click Save

## Change the status of an inventory item

If you do not want to take inventory into account, each item can be deactivated. By doing so, the system will no longer calculate the quantity of the product in stock, nor will it have more information on the stock.

For better room management, we recommend that you activate inventory management for all items.

1. Go to Main Menu> Inventory
2. Select the article whose status you want to change
3. Update the inventory status
4. Click Save
