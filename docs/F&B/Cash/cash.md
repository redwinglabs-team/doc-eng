# Cash desk

The Payments section of FnB is where you can create payment types, add payment terminals, configure payment processing, and access charge information.

The cash desk is divided into two macro sections: the Order and the Account in order to guarantee 360 ​​° payment management.

## Order

The order represents a summary of the order, but unlike the account, it has no tax implications or direct links with payments. The creation of an order is automatic every time the checkout is accessed.

Changes are allowed to the order such as: adding a dish, transferring it to the beam and vice versa and assigning it to a guest.

Below we will analyze in detail the functions of an Order.

### Add a dish to your order

Whether the order is empty (eg payment at the cashier for individual items) or contains an order for a table, it is possible to add one or more dishes from the restaurant menu.

1. Go to Main Menu> Cashier or go to Main Menu> Spaces> Pay (selecting a table with active command)
2. Select a Menu category
3. Select a dish
4. Enter the Quantity
5. Click Create

Menu items added directly to the checkout are automatically considered as "Centerpieces". If the order is empty, it is automatically sent to the kitchen for preparation.

### Delete an order

Before paying for an order, you can modify it at will by eliminating the dishes it contains. If so, you can proceed with deleting the entire order.

1. Go to Main Menu> Cashier
2. Click on Delete Order
3. Click Delete

2. Click Add Customer
3. Search for the customer or select them from the list
4. Click Add

### Transfer Orders
