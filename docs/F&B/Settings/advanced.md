# Configuration of fiscal printers

Set up printer profiles in Restaurant Manager for each physical printer in your restaurant environment (eg Receipt, fiscal, kitchen or bar printers). If you have four unique printers in your restaurant, you should have four printers configured in Restaurant Manager.

Once printers are added to Restaurant Manager, they can be linked to printer models so that particular types of print jobs are sent to the correct printer model.

Note that adding a physical printer to Restaurant Manager also requires some hardware settings and network configurations.

2. Click on the + button

### Finding the IP address of a fiscal printer

IP address of the printer on the network.

To retrieve the printer's IP address:

1. Turn on the printer and connect it to the network you use for your devices.
2. To ensure that the printer's IP address does not change, the printer must be assigned a static (reserved) IP address in the router settings.
3. Turn off the printer.
4. While holding down the Feed button, turn on the printer and continue pressing the Feed button for approximately 7 seconds. The IP address appears on the printed receipt.
