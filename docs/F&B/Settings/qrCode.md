# QR code generator

A QR code is a type of barcode and authentication tool for smart devices. QR codes are often used on posters, cards, and websites to quickly connect a customer's phone to a certain platform. Basically, you scan a QR code with your smart device, the smart device reads the code, and then you are redirected to an external link.

The QR code generator allows you to better facilitate contactless orders with your customers. To use QR codes, set them up in the FnB Menu and then print them as table marks or add them as an image to your website. Once configured, customers scan your QR codes with their phones and are automatically taken to your web app with the required menu.

## Create a new QR code

1. Go to Main Menu> Settings> QR Code
2. Click on the + button
3. Scan or print the QR code

Once you've finished setting up the QR code, you can select Print Preview at the top of the page to print or save the image.

The QR code does not need to be modified. In fact, any change to the menu is automatically recorded on the menu accessible via QR code.
