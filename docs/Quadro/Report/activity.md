## Activity report

To access the Activity report section go to Main Menu> Report> Activity

The Activity Report is a great tool for analyzing your property's operations. This is a weekly and hourly graphical display to help recognize the busiest operating hotspots.

This graph shows squares, which represent the number of activities occurring over the time period they are in. Hover over the squares to see the number of activities represented in each.

Tracked activities include check-in, check-out, reservation creation and room status changes to clean or inspect. Select a specific activity to see an overview of who completed the most activities. This is one of the many great ways to use this report to improve hotel performance.

### Functionality

#### Operational hotspots

A member of the management team should be available in all critical and busy operational hotspots. Facilities can often have a large number of arrivals or departures on the first day of the week.
These hotspots are a key to making or breaking a customer experience. Use this report to highlight the most active days and times in your facility. Create your schedule using this report to ensure management is optimal, breaks are scheduled outside these windows and improve guest satisfaction by making yourself available when you need them most.

#### Booking trends

Often, when guests book at your property, they've already reviewed options and availability ahead of time and returned to finalize their bookings.
Use this report to check trends or statistics. Filter the results to see what time or day of the week your guests book your property. If you see a specific trend, use this information to create targeted promotional material.
For example, if you see a lot of bookings being made on Mondays, you could raise your rates that night to generate some extra revenue.

#### Housekeeping application

For most properties, the average cleaning shift starts at 08:00 and ends at 16:00. Therefore, in theory, the rooms are cleaned and inspected in the same order. However, using this report, you will find that most of the rooms are changed to be inspected between 3pm and 4pm.
This means that housekeepers don't have the tools to communicate easily and quickly when they're done cleaning a room. This miscommunication often has a negative effect on guests, as rooms may be clean and ready, but guests are not yet able to check in before the official check-in time.
