  Click on the small arrow at the bottom next to each item in the report to expand it and see more information.
  The Accounting Report lists the products only once, on the date of consumption. Products ordered by night are also grouped into one item (for example, if a guest stays for 3 nights and orders "Parking" per night, the accounting report will list "Parking" with a count of "1" after checking out of the guest). This is different from how the products are listed in the Products Report, so the "Count" in these reports will be different
