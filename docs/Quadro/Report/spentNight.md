### Filters

- Start: Select a start date to limit the results to a specific time period.
- End: Select an end date to limit the results to a specific time period.
- Age: You can also filter guests by their age, this is important for calculating the tourist tax, as you often only have to pay for a certain age group.
- Segments: You can filter the report by segments to see how many guests have stayed at the hotel from each segment. This will help you if for example you only have to pay the sojourn tax for tourists, so that you can filter guests for pleasure.
