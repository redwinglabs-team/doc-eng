## Product report

To access the Product report section go to Main Menu> Report> Product

The product report is a chronological overview of all products sold during the stay. You can choose which service you want to view the report for. The report shows the total number of guests on a specific day and how many products were sold in each category.

For example, if the "Breakfast" column shows: 61/75, it means that 61 of the 75 total guests that day have breakfast included in the rate.

This ratio can be used by the kitchen / restaurant to plan ahead the amount of breakfast / lunches / dinners booked in advance. Alternatively, the housekeeping service can use it to monitor the number of extra beds booked.

The product report is updated daily. For example, if a guest stays for 3 nights and orders "Parking" every night of their stay, the Product Report will show "Parking" with a count of "3". This is different from the way products are listed in the accounting report, so the "count" in these reports will be different.

Each product has a unique setting, which defines whether it is "consumed after the night". Most products such as rollaway beds, dinners, etc., should be set up as pre-overnight products.

However, a product that does not follow this logic is breakfast, which is eaten only after spending the night (logically, breakfast is only eaten after sleeping). If you have such a product, you will see that the number of breakfasts jumps to one day later.
