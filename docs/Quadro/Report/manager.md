### Report data

The results are grouped according to the type of space. In addition to information about each type of space, each core group includes the following information:

- Revenue: Total sum of revenues from the overnight stay for each type of space in the group.
- Product Revenue: Revenue from products linked to the group. For a complete breakdown of these revenues, you can use the Accounting Report
- Additional Revenue: Additional revenue for this group, related to cancellations and discounts.
- Total Revenue: Total sum of revenue, product revenue, and additional revenue for this group.
  For each type of space in your property, you will see the following information:
- Occupancy: Percentage of spaces occupied in the selected time period.
- Availability: Number of spaces available in the selected time period
- Occupied: Number of spaces occupied in the selected time period.
- Occupied by other services: Number of spaces occupied by a service other than the stay service.
- Out of Service: Number of spaces marked as out of service in the selected time period. Spaces out of service are not included in the occupancy calculation because they are not available for booking.
- Revenue per night: Revenue linked to this specific type of space or to any type of "secondary" space. For example, if a bed in a dorm is booked for 10 euros, that income will be listed as overnight income for both the beds and the - dorms. However, 10 euros of revenue related to a dorm reservation will not be listed as nightly revenue for the overnight stay.
- Revenue by availability: The revenue for the overnight stay divided by the number of available spaces of that type.
- Average Nightly Rate: The revenue per night divided by the number of occupied spaces of that type.
- Revenue for direct overnight stay: Revenue linked directly to the type of space reserved. For example, if a bed in a dorm is booked for 10 euros, that income will be listed as overnight income for the beds. However, the 10 euros will not be listed as overnight entry for the dorms.
- Users: number of guests in the house who have directly booked a space of that type during the selected period
  N.B. Current month results are all results for the current month, including the current day. For example, if it's the second day of the month, the month start results will only include data from the first two days. Similarly, the results from the beginning of the year are all the results for the current year, including the current day.
