# Spaces

## Space status report

To see the section go to Main Menu > Spaces.

The Spaces section can be used by the housekeeping department and by managers to always keep an eye on the cleanliness of the rooms in your facility. A schematic summary of the data in this section is also present in the Quadro Dashboard.

Below you will find a detailed description of all the functions and filters available in this section

### Housekeeping assignment

At the top of the page, on the right, is the assignment button, which represents one of the most important features of this section:

- Employee assignment: this button allows you to uniformly assign rooms to the employees of the housekeeping department on duty at your property
  Once the button is clicked, the assignment form will open, where you will have to fill in the following fields:
- Employees: Select which employees to assign to certain rooms. If several employees are selected, the rooms will be distributed evenly among them. Note that each space can be assigned to an employee
- Type of space: select which type of space to assign to employees.
  N.B. Putting a room out of service will not limit its availability within the previous form, but putting it out of service will.
  Click the Assign button once you have checked all the fields entered and wait for the successful notification of the operation
  Once this is done, you will be redirected to the room management section, where you will see the details just entered.

### Filters

At the top of the page there are several options that you can select in order to better manage the view of the report:

- Dates: select a date to narrow the search to the selected day. The date filter will be automatically filled in with today's date
- Assignee: Select the employee from the drop-down menu to restrict the results to only the rooms assigned to that employee
- Status: restricts the search for rooms to their state of cleanliness
  - Clean
  - Dirty
  - Inspected
  - Out of order
  - Out of order
- Space category: restricts the search to only rooms belonging to that space category

### Features

The room report is usually organized as a list of all the spaces sorted by floor. Use the filters available to change the page view and the order of the spaces.

Each room is followed by a drop-down menu from which it is possible to change its status.

The primary function is the real-time representation of current and future reservations, with the vertical dashed line placed to indicate the current time.

Each booking shows the following information

- Date or time of arrival: if arrival is expected on the same day, the time will also be shown, otherwise only the date will be shown
- Number of pax: number of guests expected to book
- Guest name: click on the guest name to connect directly to their user profile
- Date or time of departure: if the departure is scheduled on the same day, the time will also be shown, otherwise only the date will be shown
  Reservations for Internal Use or rooms blocked due to Breakdown will be shown with the following details:
- Start date or time: if the start is scheduled for the same day, the time will also be shown, otherwise only the date will be shown
- Name: name entered when created. It can be a short description of the problem or the reason for booking
- End date or time: if the end is scheduled for the same day, the time will also be shown, otherwise only the date will be shown
  Additionally, upcoming events will be displayed with a lightning bolt icon, indicating guests will arrive soon and all final arrangements should be completed urgently.

### Out of order

Faulting a camera is an important decision that should be made at least by a supervisor. A faulty room will be excluded from the inventory and cannot be booked for the duration of the selected period. Staff should only use this status if there are no other options.

#### Set space status to out of order

Click on the number of the room you want to put in fault, then click on the fault button. A screen will appear with the following fields to fill in:

- Block name: Enter a short description of the problem
- Space assignment: this field will be automatically filled in with the room number you clicked on earlier. You can however select a different option from the drop-down menu
- Start: select the start time and date of the block
- End: select the date and time of the block end and the automatic renewed room availability. Remember that the room status will automatically change to Dirty at the end of the block
- Notes: It is important to include the reason why you are placing the lock on the room in question so that we can inform all staff. You can also include any other information regarding the problem
  Click on the Create button. The details of the block will be listed in the tableau of the rooms. You can change the information it contains at any time by clicking on the block name.
  Please note that if a parent space is marked as broken, automatically all the spaces contained in it will be blocked at the same time.

### Automatic changes

#### Internal use and out of order

When a room is booked for internal use or Breakdown, the user must specify both the start and end dates, information that will be visible in the Timeline. Once the block end date and time has arrived, the status of the room will automatically switch to Dirty.

#### Vacant

If a room is not occupied for more than seven consecutive days, its status will automatically change to Dirty to remind housekeeping employees that the bathroom areas must be cleaned.

#### Busy

Each night, the system will automatically change the status of all occupied rooms in Dirty

#### Room change

When you move a reservation that has already been checked-in from one room to another, the status of both rooms will be changed to Dirty, including a note that says "Room change".

#### No show

In the event of a reservation no show, the room status will no longer change to Dirty overnight. This is based on the assumption that no one has taken possession of that room and therefore there is no reason to change its status to dirty.
