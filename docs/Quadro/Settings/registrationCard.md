# Registration card

## How do I set up registration cards?

As a rule, registration cards are set up in such a way that they require all the information required by law established by your state. If you wish to request more information from guests, you can update the registration forms at any time.

1. Go to Main Menu> Settings> Registration Cards
2. Select the format in which to print your registration cards
3. Under Options, choose what information to ask guests. We recommend that you only ask for the information required by law (to streamline check-in as much as possible)
4. Under Description, enter any text you want printed on the cards.
5. If you want to translate the text into another language, find the Add translation item and choose the language from the drop-down menu. A new box will automatically appear below the selected field, so you can add your translation
6. Click on Save
   N.B. If you choose to show the rate on the registration forms, be aware that if you have routing rules configured for a company or a travel agency, the rate will not be shown on the form:
