From the Prices tab (or Rate Management / Rate Management), you can:

* Set the base price of a fare
* Adapt a price for entire categories of space
* Cancel a price for specific dates

### Info

The table on this page contains the following information:

* The Occupation row shows your daily occupancy. The darker the occupancy box on a given day, the higher the occupancy rate on that day. Expand this row to see your daily occupancy broken down into space types.
* Your base price is the price on which all other prices are based. Expand this row to see the price of each space category per night. Changes to the basic rate are highlighted, and a small triangle in the corner of a box indicates that the price has been overwritten for that type of space and the date

### Adapt a price for entire categories of space

If you want to change prices for entire room categories, you can create a base price change. Click on the space category and complete the following fields:

* Basic modification category: if you want your price to be modified from the base price of another category of space, choose it here
* Price changes: You can change the cost of a room category through the following methods
    * General changes: the following fields assign a price per room by calculating the directives entered
        * Absolute Change: Enter a specific amount that will determine the price, modified by the category of the base change you select
        * Relative Change: Enter a percentage that will determine the price, modified by the category of the base change selected
        * Change for extra bed: enter the amount to add or subtract from the base price of the room for each extra bed (e.g. base price = 50, change for extra bed = 20, base price + 1 extra bed = 70)
        * Change for empty bed: enter the amount to add or subtract from the base room price for each empty bed
    * Specific changes: you can set the price per room for each occupant individually based on the categories set. The first category represents adults, any categories below refer to the age groups created in the settings.

Then click Update

!!! Note
    If both methods are completed, the system will give priority to the data entered in the fields relating to specific changes.

### Change a price for specific dates

If you want to change the price of a certain space category on a certain date, you can create a price override. Click on the box with the price you want to change and fill in the following fields:

* Start - select the first day of the time period for which you want to create a price change
* End - select the last day of the time period for which you want to create a price change
* Overwrite - enter the price you want the space category to cost for the chosen period

Choose the days you want the change to take effect, then click New Price Change

!!! Note
    When you create a price override, the next day's price (in the same space category) is selected, so you can easily adjust multiple prices in series.
