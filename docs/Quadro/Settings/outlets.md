# Outlets

## Set up outlets

If your property has separate sources of income from overnight that accept payments other than Quadro (for example, a restaurant that accepts direct payments), you can integrate it into our system by setting up outlets.
Before you can set up outlets, you must:

- Integrate the outlet with the store
- Create a service for each of the outlets
- Create an accounting category for each of the outlets
  The outlets track external revenues, therefore you cannot track the revenues obtained except through the use of external software (eg FnB

### Create an outlet

1. From the Main Menu go to Settings> Outlets
2. Click on the + button
3. Enter the name of the outlet
4. Click on Save. Repeat the operation for each point of sale of your property

### Connect an outlet to your point-of-sale integration

Before you can track outlet revenue in Quadro, you need to make sure you've connected your outlets to a service and an accounting category.
The process of connecting your outlets to services and accounting categories will differ depending on which point of sale system you're using, but you may need to find mapping IDs.

#### Learn how to find an OutletID

1. Go to Main menu > Settings > Property.
2. Click on Outlets.
3. Click on the name of the outlet you want to find the ID for.
4. The "OutletID" is the long code at the end of the URL of this page (everything after the last " / ").

#### Learn how to find a ServiceID

1. Go to Main menu > Settings > Services.
2. Click on the name of the service you want to find the ID for.
3. The "ServiceID" is the long code at the end of the URL of this page (everything after the last " / ").

##### Check your outlet revenue

1. Go to Main menu > Finance > Accounting report.
2. The revenue from your outlets will be listed in two places:Revenue that was put on a guest bill will be listed in the Revenue section. Revenue from payments that were taken at the cost center (eg. the bar) will be listed in the Outlets section.
   N.B. If you take money through your outlets but the Outlets section of the Accounting Report shows nothing, you need to make sure your outlets are mapped to accounting categories (if you don't do this, it'll be difficult to tell where revenue has come from).
