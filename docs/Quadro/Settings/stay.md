# Bookable services

## Introduction to services

When a customer reserves accommodation at your property, they’re purchasing your bookable service. If you create additional services (as opposed to bookable services), they, and any attached products, will have to be purchased on site and manually added to the customer's bill in Quadro.

Every product has to be attached to a bookable service. If you want customers to be able to purchase something with their reservation, you need to create a product that's attached to a bookable service.

### Overview of bookable service settings

1. From the main menu go to **Settings** > **Bookable services**

# Segment

## Segment management

Use segments to classify bookings based on some information relevant to your operation (eg. Reason for stay, Type of customer)
Segments can be assigned to travel agencies, channel managers, rates and reservations. This favors the creation of more detailed reporting, useful for targeting customers more effectively.
After creating a segment, you can adjust its uses:
Allow employees to assign segments when creating reservations
Automatically apply certain segments as defaults

### Create a segment

1. From the Main Menu go to Settings> Segments
2. Click the + button
3. Enter the name of the segment
6. Click on Save
