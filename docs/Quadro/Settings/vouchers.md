## Create a voucher

Vouchers offer access to dedicated rates for customers, companies or travel agencies. Before creating a voucher, you need to create the private rate it will be attached to.

### Create a voucher

1. From the Main Menu go to Settings> Vouchers
2. Click the + button
3. Enter the name of the voucher
4. If the rate is dedicated to a company or a travel agency, select them from the respective fields. N.B. It is not possible to link a voucher to both a company and a travel agency at the same time
5. Select the rates you want the voucher to be attached to (if you don't select a rate, the voucher won't work)
6. Click on Save

### Create the voucher code

When the voucher is created, a voucher code is also automatically created
A voucher code cannot be changed, so if you want to update some of its fields, you need to create a new one

1. From the main menu go to Settings> Vouchers
2. Click on the voucher for which you want to create a voucher code
3. Click the + button
4. In the Code field, update the code name or keep the previously generated unique value automatically
5. In the Valid From and Valid To fields, enter the dates on which the voucher is active and can be used. If you do not select any date, the voucher code will be valid from the moment it is created until it is canceled
6. Click on Save
