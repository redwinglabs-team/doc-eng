A default Service or Stay Service is automatically created by the software as a Bookable Service, however you can still create, modify or delete other Services.

If you create a new Additional Service, customers will not be able to buy that service (or the products associated with it) when they make their reservation; the service or product must first be purchased online and then manually added to the customer's account

If you want to provide the ability for customers to purchase something at the time of booking, you must necessarily create a product linked to the default Bookable Service.
