# Restrictions

## Set up price restrictions

A price restriction prevents entry of a reservation if a single night costs less or more than a specified price. Restrictions can apply to:

- Rates (all or some specifics)
- Rate groups
- Space categories
- Types of space
  When creating a price restriction, you can choose whether to apply it based on the arrival date, departure date or period of stay:
- Arrival: A reservation starting during the restricted period cannot be made unless each night has the asking price
- Departure: A reservation that ends during the restricted period cannot be made unless each night of the reservation has the requested price
- Stay: a reservation with some nights present in the restricted period cannot be made unless each night has the requested price
