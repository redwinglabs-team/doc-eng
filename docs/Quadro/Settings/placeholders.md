## Customize your emails

Quadro sends emails at your request to guests to inform them about changes related to their booking, missed charges and more. Most of these emails can be customized, but, if you choose not to customize an email, we will send a pre-set standard email.
Tip: When you personalize an email, you can translate it into any language you prefer.

1. From the Main Menu go to Settings> Placeholder Email
2. Click the + button
3. Select the type of template you want to customize
4. Click on Save
5. To create multi-language versions of emails, find the "Add Translation" button and select the language.
6. Enter the subject and body of the email
7. Click on Save

### Fully customizable emails

Each part of these emails can be fully customized with HTML and placeholders
Placeholders add dynamic information to your emails, for example, the customer's name.
