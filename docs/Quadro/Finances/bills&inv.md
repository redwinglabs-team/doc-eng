# Bills & invoices

## Bills and invoices report

To access the Accounts and Invoices Report section, go to Main Menu > Finance > Accounts and Invoices

The Invoices and Accounts report is an overview of all issued invoices and closed accounts. This is a great resource if you need to find an invoice after a customer leaves for reprint or review.

This report is divided into two sections for invoices and accounts. Invoices are sorted numerically, from lowest to highest number, while accounts can be found both numerically and chronologically.

This report is based on the selected range, which always appears as part of the report header, right next to the title. If you know the invoice number, you can search by invoice number at the top of the screen. Alternatively, you can use the date and time selectors to select a specific period during which the invoice or account was closed and then refine your search.

Below, you will find an overview of all the filters and features available in this report.
