## Items

### Add products to a new booking

We have added a product field to the new booking screen that allows you to:

* Choose how many products to add to a new booking
* Add additional products and ancillary services to the booking (eg. Bike rental or ski pass)
* Add different products for adults and children
    * This will make it even easier to accurately price prices for family bookings

#### Prerequisite: Create your own child products

Before you can add child products to bookings, you need to create them first. To do this, you need to create two different versions of the same product, one with an adult price, and another with a child price.

We always recommend adding an adult or child to the name of your products in order to avoid confusion when adding the product (eg Breakfast (adult) and Breakfast (Child)

#### Add products

1. When you are making a new booking, select the products you want to add under the Products item
2. Expand the product container by clicking on the small arrow at the bottom just above the item of the Total
3. Click on the pencil icon and update the quantity of the product
4. Click the + and - buttons to change the quantity of the product
    * N.B. you cannot change the number of people or nights to which the product is applied

## Billing

### Add, move or remove products from open bills

Before closing an account, you can make any necessary changes to the products it contains.

#### Add services to an open bill

When someone makes a reservation, the overnight stay (nights) and all products packaged with the overnight stay are added to the billing card of the customer profile.

If the settlement is automatic, the items are added to an open invoice with payment and the invoice is closed; if the settlement is manual, they are added to the Billing tab as unpaid items, which can be moved to an open invoice later.

If a customer orders a service or product directly through you (instead of buying it with their accommodation), you can manually add it to their invoice in Quadro.

#### Add a product to an open bill

2. Go to the Billing section
3. Find the + Add Product button
4. Select the product you want to add and change the quantity
5. Click Create. The product will be added to the selected account belonging to the reservation holder. Click on Payments to pay the bill with the newly added products.

##### The Product is not linked to your bookable service

If the guest buys a product or service that is not related to your bookable service, you can add them directly to the unpaid items in the Accounts section of their profile or booking.

1. Open the guest profile
2. Go to the Accounts section
3. Find the + Add product button and select the item you want to add to the selected account
4. If the service has multiple products, you can click the + or - icons to add or remove any product to the account
