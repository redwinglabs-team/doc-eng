# Timeline

To view the history of all reservations, go to Main Menu> Reservations> Timeline.

The Timeline is the graphical display of all bookings in a selected time period, organized primarily by room type and secondly by room number within that room type. On the Timeline you can zoom in or out, so you can see the Timeline with more or less data. This is useful not only for viewing more bookings simultaneously, but also for optimizing use on mobile devices.

Below, you can find a detailed description of all the features, filters and data available on the Timeline and how to best use them.

### Reservation colors

- Yellow: Reservations that require action today. They are either bookings that need to be checked in or checked out by the end of today.
- Black: Reservations that are currently in the hotel and do not require any action within today. They are already checked in and have a check-out date that is on a date later than today.
- Blue: Reservations that are either in the past or future and do not overlap with today, thus not requiring any action within today.
- Gray: Reservations that are indicating out of order rooms. Once a room is placed out of order, it is no longer available for sale. House use bookings are also indicated in grey.
- Orange: Reservations that require urgent action, such as no shows or options that have expired.
- Dotted line: Reservations that have not yet been confirmed or reached their release date.

### Housekeeping status colors

- Dark green: Inspected room
- Grey: Out of service room
- Red: Dirty room
- Black: Out of order room
- Green: Clean room
- Yellow: Cleaning in progress room

### Filters

At the top of the Timeline there are some different filters:

- Arrows: Double arrows move the history forward or back by one month. Single arrows move the history forward or back by one week
- Today: This button will always take you to today's date, which will always be highlighted
- Select Date: Use this date picker to quickly jump to a specific date
- Select space: Search by name of space categories or by room number in order to display the spaces with the corresponding criteria in the drop-down menu.
- Reservation for internal use: ??

### Spaces

The far left column of the Timeline contains a list of your space categories. As you zoom back and forth, you may notice that Short Names are often used in this case, as space becomes limited. Within each of these space categories, you will see all corresponding names or space numbers, each with its own row. If any spaces contain other spaces, you will see that the one represented as each subsequent space will also have its own line on the Timeline.

All space numbers are clickable and form a direct link to the corresponding space structure page for each of them. The space structure page for each of them contains all the details regarding the status of that space. From this screen, you can quickly change the room status to Dirty, Clean, Ready for Check In, Temporarily Out of Service, or Out of Use. You can also find a summary of all recent blocks Under Repair and all recent space status changes. Space numbers are also displayed in the corresponding space state color for easy identification.

### Reservations

Reservations appear as blocks on the Timeline, which occupy a period of time corresponding to the duration of the reservation. The space blocks in the Timeline all accurately represent both the arrival and departure times for each booking and are always displayed in the appropriate action color.

Each reservation is displayed with the name of the reservation owner in Last Name, First Name format. If the customer has been assigned any of the Customer Ratings, you will also see the corresponding icons immediately after the customer name.

You may also find a Padlock icon displayed before the customer name, which is described in more detail below.

When you click on a reservation, a window opens with the reservation details. From this screen you can select the Manage or Group buttons to open the Reservation Form, or use the applicable action button to Check in or Check out that reservation. Within Simple Detail, you can click on the icon next to the guest's name for a direct link to the customer's profile, where you can manage your personal data as needed.

### Move

Click, drag and drop unlocked booking blocks to move them to the Timeline. You can use this method to upgrade reservations to a higher space category.

Once a booking has been dragged to a higher category, an Up Arrow icon will appear on the booking block in front of the customer's name, indicating that the booking has been upgraded to a higher category.

The Timeline does not allow reservations to be downgraded to a lower category using drag and drop, which is useful for preventing accidental downgrades.

If an unlocked booking block is moved and then dropped onto another, the system will automatically try to reassign the booking that was previously in that slot. If there is no other suitable room, the reservation will be placed in an overbooked place. Once a reservation is placed in the overbook slot, it must be manually moved to a suitable room assignment. For more information on overbooking, see below.

### Lock or unlock

When you select a booking on the Timeline, all booking information will appear in the Simple Detail window on the right. Within this window is the Padlock icon, which can be used to lock or unlock this reservation from modification.

Blocking the reservation means that the reservation can no longer be moved. Padlocks are mainly used to prevent employees from accidentally moving reservations. Properties may want to block a reservation for various reasons, for example, a returning guest may have specifically requested the assigned seat.

Reservations will be automatically unlocked by the system only if the arrival or departure dates are changed. Therefore, please note that after changing these booking details, the user must block the booking again to prevent it from being moved.

### Overbooking

When new reservations are created, they are automatically assigned to a space on the Timeline. If a facility has overbooked a category, i.e. it has created more bookings than the number of seats available, the system will automatically create overbooking slots in which to place the booking until the property is able to resolve the conflict.

These slots are displayed in red, indicating that urgent action is needed, and are used as a temporary placeholder for reservations that have not yet been moved to an available space.

You can resolve the overbooking by moving the reservation block from the overbooking slot to a free space, which will automatically remove the overbooking slot from the Timeline.
