# Reservation Overview

## Reservation list

To view the booking overview, click __Main Menu__ > __Bookings__ > __Overview__

The Booking Overview report is a quick snapshot of all relevant bookings that day. This report always shows the most up-to-date status of remaining arrivals and departures to ensure that the front office is able to check which guests and bookings require an intervention before the end of the day.

Below you will find a complete overview of all the functions and filter options available for this report. The report itself is divided into five sections. For the Arrivals, Departures, Overnights and In House sections, the booking forms are used to provide a summary of all booking details for easy reference.

!!! Note
    If a booking is made for more than one person, but there is no travel companion assigned to the booking, the registration card for that companion will be printed blank. Please make sure you have a guest assigned to your booking to avoid further card data transfers to the system.

## Check in a reservation

1. Open the reservation you want to check-in for
2. Go to the Status section
   - If the booking is part of a group and you want to check in for more than one booking at once, please make sure you have selected all relevant bookings on the right side of the screen
3. Find the Spaces section
   - If the assigned room has completed the inspection, you can check-in for that reservation
4. Decide if you want to create room keys (if you don't want to, you can always create them after the guest has checked-in)

## Add, move, or remove items from open bills

Before closing a bill, you can make any necessary changes to the products it contains.

### Add items to an open bill

If a customer orders a service or product directly with you (instead of purchasing it with their accommodation), you can manually add it to their bill in Quadro.

### Add a product to an open bill

#### The product is connected to your bookable service (e.g. Stay Service)

If a customer wants to purchase a product that is usually packaged with stay (i.e., the product is attached to your bookable service), you need to add it through their reservation.

1. Open the reservation.
2. Go to the Billing tab.
3. Find the Add product section.
4. Select the product you want to add, and enter the product count.
5. Click Add. The product will be added to the billing tab of the reservation owner's customer profile, under Unpaid items / Deposits.

#### The product isn't connected to your bookable service (e.g. Stay Service)

If a customer purchases a product or service that isn’t connected to accommodation, you can add it directly to their unpaid items in the billing tab of their customer profile.

1. Open the customer's profile.
2. Go to the Billing tab.
3. Find the Unpaid items / Deposits section, and click ⌄ to expand. 
4. Click Add product, then select the product you want to add from the dropdown. 
5. If the service has multiple sub-products, you can click the + or - buttons to add or remove any products that should or shouldn't be on the bill.
6. Click Create.

### Transfer bill items

#### Transfer bill items to another customer

1. Open the customer's profile.
2. Go to the Billing tab.
3. Expand the bill with the items you want to transfer. 
4. If you want to move all the items from that bill, click Move all items. If you want to move specific items from the bill, select them and then click Move selected items. 
5. Select the customer and bill you want to transfer the item(s) to.

#### Transfer bill items to a company

Currently, you can't move individual bill items to a company bill—you can only move entire bills.  If you don't want to move all the items on a bill to a company, move them to a new bill first.

1. Open the customer's profile.
2. Go to the Billing tab.
3. Find the bill you want to transfer to a company. 
4. Click Company.
5. Search for the company you want to transfer the bill to, and click Move.
