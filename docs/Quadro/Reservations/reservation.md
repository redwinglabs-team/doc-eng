## Create a reservation

In Quadro, you can create a new booking manually

### Step 1: Choose when and where they'll stay

In this step, you can choose where and when to make the reservation

1. Click on the + button located in the toolbar at the top right
2. If your hotel is part of a chain, you can select the hotel from the drop-down menu under the heading Structure.
3. Select the dates chosen by the guest for the stay.

### Step 2: Add reservations to your cart

In this step, you can check the availability of the property and add reservations to the cart

1. Under Booking, enter the guest's name to search for him or her in the registry or create a new profile. You can also link the booking to a third party booker, a Travel Agency, a company, a voucher or a segment. By selecting a Travel Agency, a company, a voucher or a segment, you will change the choice of rates available for 2. booking. If the guest wishes to add products to his stay (eg Breakfast), you can add them from this screen. (link to Add products to a new booking)
2. Under Availability, select the type of room the guest wishes to book. After selecting the room type, you will see the availability of rooms for that category.
3. Just below the chosen room category, select the number of rooms the guest intends to book and the number of adults and children in each of them.
4. Select the rate to be applied per night
   - Rates are sorted by rate group; find the rate group you want, and select the rate from the drop-down menu below
   - The lowest rate for the selected room category will be highlighted in bold
5. Click the + button just below the rate price to add the reservation to the cart
   - If the + button is gray, a restriction is preventing you from adding the room to your cart. Click on the link next to the gray + button to connect directly to your restrictions page, find the reason that prevents you from completing your booking and change it if necessary
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 in case you want to create a multiple booking
   - After adding a reservation (or room) to your cart, you can change some details in the Reservations section before adding another. For example, if you are creating a reservation with a product called "Breakfast", deselect the product before adding another reservation to the cart (if you do not want breakfast included)
7. After adding all the required bookings to your cart, click Next

### Step 3: Add the final details

In this step, you can add the final details and create the booking

1. If you did not connect the booking to any user profile during the previous step, enter the user name to search or create a new profile in Quadro.
   - You can also enter the name of the booker if someone is booking instead of the guest
2. Enter the origin of the reservation
3. Fill in all relevant fields
   - You can choose whether the booking has been confirmed, is it an option or a request. If the reservation is an option or a request, set a date on which it will be released in case of no confirmation
   - You can also choose whether or not to send a confirmation (if the reservation is confirmed) or a quote (if it is an option or a request) by email to the customer; if you choose to send the email, select the language in which to send it.
4. Check that all bookings are correct (you can always go back to the previous steps to change something, or change bookings directly from the cart)
5. Click on Book Now

## Ad products to a new reservation

We have added a product field to the new booking screen that allows you to:

1. Choose how many products to add to a new booking
2. Add additional products and auxiliary services to your booking (eg. Bike rental or ski pass)
3. Add different products for adults and children
   - This will make it even easier to accurately price prices for family bookings

### Prerequisite: Create your child products

Before you can add baby products to bookings, you need to create them first. To do this, you need to create two different versions of the same product, one with an adult price and another with a child price. We always recommend adding an adult or child to the name of your products in order to avoid confusion when adding the product (eg Breakfast (adult) and Breakfast (Child)

### Add products

1. When you are making a new booking, select the products you want to add under Products
2. Expand the product container by clicking on the small arrow at the bottom just above the item of the Total
3. Click on the pencil icon and update the quantity of the product
4. Click the + and - buttons to change the quantity of the product
   N.B. you cannot change the number of people or nights to which the product is applied

## Cancel a reservation

Before a reservation has gone through the check-in process, it can be canceled. When the time window in which changes can be made ends, the reservation can no longer be canceled.

!!! Nota
    Canceling a reservation is a permanent operation. If you want to restore a reservation, you will need to create it again

1. Open the reservation you wish to cancel
2. Go to the Status section. If the reservation is part of a group, select all the reservations you want to cancel on the right side of the screen (to cancel them simultaneously). Make sure you have selected only the reservations you want to cancel as the operation is irreversible
3. Find the Cancellation section
4. Select the reasons for the cancellation and fill in the relevant fields
5. Choose whether or not to apply cancellation fees. Send an email confirming the cancellation to the guest
6. Click Ok

!!! Nota   
    If you cancel a reservation with a closed invoice, a discount is automatically created to cancel the invoice. After cancellation, the consumption date of the invoice items is set to the date and time when the items were discounted

!!! Nota
    You cannot cancel a reservation that is currently in the house. If a guest needs to leave early, you can anticipate the check-out procedure
