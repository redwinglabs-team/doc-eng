## Availability report

To see the availability report, go to Main Menu > Distribution > Availability.

The availability report offers the same filters already analyzed in the occupancy report (link here). For each day of the week, each space category will be listed with:

- The number of rooms available
- The total cost charged for each room occupied
- A black bar that acts as an employment indicator
  For an in-depth description of the data and filters in this section, we recommend reading our article on the Employment Report (link here)

### Creating availability adjustments

From the Availability Report, you can adjust your availability by adding or removing spaces from a space category.

1. To create an availability adjustment, click on the number of available spaces in a block, and complete the following fields:
   - Start - Select the date you want the availability of your space category to be adjusted from.
   - End - Select the date you want the availability of your space category to be adjusted until.
   - Count - Enter the availability adjustment (for example, enter "-2" to remove two spaces from your space category).
