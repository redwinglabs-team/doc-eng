## Occupancy report

To view the Occupancy Report, go to Main Menu> Distribution> Occupancy.

The occupancy report is a schematic overview of all types of space, the number of spaces in each category, and the business on-the books for each type of space per day. The overview offers information on occupancy, availability and your nightly rates for each category of space.

### Reported data

The report shows the occupancy and availability of each category of space per day. Each space category is listed with the total number of spaces in that category.
For each day of the week, each space category is listed with:

- The total percentage of occupied spaces.
- The total amount of money charged for occupied spaces.
- A bar indicating employment. 
  - A black bar means that the space category has no direct overbooking on that date. If the space category has indirect overbooking, the bar will show the number of free spaces in that space category. 
  - An orange bar means that the space category has a direct overbook on that date. When a space category is overbooked, the number of free seats and spaces will be negative (corresponding to the number of overbookings).

Hover over a block to view the following additional information:

- Spaces: Number of spaces in the selected category.
- Occupancy: Percentage of a category of space that is occupied on a given day.
- Busy: Number of spaces occupied on a given day.
- Indoor Uses: Number of spaces used for indoor use on a given day.
- Out of order: Number of spaces that are out of order on a given day
- Free Spaces: Number of spaces that are physically unoccupied.
- Direct Overbooking: Number of spaces on a given day that have been directly overbooked. Direct overbookings occur when the number of reservations assigned to a space category exceeds the number of spaces.
- Indirect overbooking: The number of spaces on a given day that have been indirectly overbooked - indirect overbooking occurs when another category of space has been overbooked, and excess bookings are reallocated (indirect - overbookings are used only for reporting purposes and do not affect the availability of the space category).
- Availability change: Changes to the number of spaces available within a space category on a given day.
- Availability: Number of spaces available on a given day.
- Arrivals: Number of spaces with guests arriving on a given day.
- Departures: Number of spaces with guests departing on a given day.
- Stay Overs: Number of spaces on a given day that have no guests arriving or departing.
- Customers: Total number of customers in the house on a given day.
- Extra beds: Number of extra beds reserved on a given day.

!!! Note  
    The number of arrivals and departures indicated in the additional information refers to the number of seats with arriving or departing guests, so it will be different from the number of Arrivals and Departures on the Dashboard (which refers to the number of bookings arriving or departing).

  N.B. Spaces used for day bookings are removed from inventory only if the booking ends after 6pm (because the room cannot be booked for an overnight stay). If the booking for a day of use ends before 6pm, it will not be removed from the inventory, so it will not be counted in the occupancy report.
