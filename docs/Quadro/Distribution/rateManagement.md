# Rate Management

From the Prices tab (or Rate Management / Rate Management), you can:

- Set the base price for a rate
- Adapt a price for entire categories of space
- Cancel a price for specific dates

### Data

The table on this page contains the following information:

- The Occupation row shows your daily occupancy. The darker the occupancy box on a given day, the higher the occupancy rate on that day. Expand this row to see your daily occupancy broken down into space types.
- Your base price is the price on which all other prices are based. Expand this row to see the price of each space category per night. Changes to the basic rate are highlighted, and a small triangle in the corner of a box indicates that the price has been overwritten for that type of space and the date

### Adjust a price for entire space categories

If you want to change prices for entire space categories, you can create a base price change. Click on the space category and complete the following fields:

- Basic modification category - if you want your price to be modified from the base price of another category of space, choose it here
- Absolute change - enter a specific amount that will determine the price, modified by the category of the base change selected
- Relative Change - enter a percentage that will determine the price, changed by the category of the base change selected
  Then click Update

### Override a price for specific dates

If you want to change the price of a certain space category on a certain date, you can create a price override. Click on the box with the price you want to change and fill in the following fields:

- Start - select the first day of the time period for which you want to create a price change
- End - select the last day of the time period for which you want to create a price change
- Overwrite - enter the price you want the space category to cost for the chosen period
  Choose the days you want the change to take effect, then click New Price Change
  N.B. when you create a price override, the next day's price (in the same space category) is selected, so you can easily adjust multiple prices in series.
