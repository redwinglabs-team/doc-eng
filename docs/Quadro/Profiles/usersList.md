## How to blacklist a customer?

If, for whatever reason, you no longer want to accept bookings from certain users, you can add them to the blacklist

1. Open your user profile
2. Go to the Preferences section
3. Under Ratings, enter Blacklist
4. Click on Save

### What if the customer tries to make a reservation?

If an employee tries to create a reservation for a blacklisted user from Quadro, an error message will appear and the reservation will not be created.
If the user tries to make a reservation through the booking engine (from your website), using the email address associated with the profile on the blacklist, he will receive a message and the reservation will not be created.

## View a customer's digital registration card

When a user goes through the online or in-facility check-in procedure, a guest registration card is created containing all the mandatory information and his signature. This card is saved in your user profile.

1. Open your user profile
2. Go to the Profile section
3. Under Files, find the registration card
4. Click on the file name to download it
