# Create a customer profile

A user can be a customer (someone who makes a reservation for someone else) or a guest (someone who stays in your facility)

!!! Note
    If your facility is part of a chain, the user profiles created for the users of your facility will be shared with all the other facilities in your chain (and vice versa)

## Create a customer profile

Most users are automatically generated in Quadro when a booking is received through the channel manager, but it is also possible to manually create a user profile. There are several procedures for creating a user profile:

- From Main Menu> Profiles> New User Profile
- By adding it to a booking as you create it
- By adding it to an existing reservation
  Start creating a user profile using one of the methods described above, and then:
- Fill in the relevant fields. Only the user's surname is required, but we recommend that you fill in the profile fields as much as possible.
- Click Create. Once you have created your user profile, you can add even more information

### Debit online via payment gateways

Whether you use Quadro guest, staff or integration of a payment gateway, you can charge your cards in Quadro with the click of a button, without the need to use a terminal.

1. On the card, enter all the payment card details.
2. Click Create.

!!! Note
  After creating a card in Quadro, it will be assigned an "Identifier": this indicates that the card has been verified by the bank and can be used for Quadro debits.

### Charging physically via terminal

If you want to debit your card on site via a payment terminal, you just need to add enough card details to track payments (as you won't be able to actually accept payments in Quadro).

1. On the Terminal tab, enter all the payment card details.
2. Click Create.

!!! Note
  Quadro does not store or have access to the complete card number. For security reasons, we only store the last four digits of the card.
