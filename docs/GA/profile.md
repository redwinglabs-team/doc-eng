# Control of guest data

Gust App is a web app compatible with any device: computer, tablet or smartphone. It does not require any download.

The Guest App is a tool that gives guests full control of their data.

With the Guest App, guests can:

- Manage what data they share with which facilities
- Request their cancellation

Guests can access their profiles by clicking the profile icon from the main menu, or by clicking on their name at the top right of the screen.

They can update their personal information, identification documents, addresses and can control the data that is shared with the facility.

For reasons of the GDPR, the guest can request the vision of all the information concerning his person that the structure possesses, or he can request its cancellation.

If a guest asks the structure to show him what data it has about him, an email will be sent to the address of the structure itself. According to the regulation, there is a period of 30 days in which the property undertakes to provide the information to the guest.

If a guest requests the deletion of their data, the property must delete all personal information saved in any software or printed in any report.
