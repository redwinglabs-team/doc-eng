# How do I respond to messages received from guests via the Guest App?

Through the Guest App, guests have the possibility to communicate directly in real time with the structure thanks to an instant messaging system.

Just click on the chat icon in the booking overview and send your message.

The message will appear instantly in the Staff App messaging center and, by default, the subject of the notification will be the guest's full name and the details of their reservation.

By clicking on the message, you can immediately reply to the guest.

An email reminder will be sent to the guest for any unread messages after 5 minutes, and they will be able to reply to the property directly from the link in the email.

At the moment, only guests can start a new conversation.

Guests also have access to the “Chat with us” link in their confirmation email.

Make sure the relevant placeholder has been incorporated into the confirmation email template.

Travel companions can also send messages to the facility. They will receive an invitation to complete their profile in the guest App and have access to the “Chat with us” link

### Make sure you

- All assigned employees respond to all messages.

- The booking notes field can be used by employees, for example, to confirm that all actions on related messages have been completed.
- At a minimum, an employee within the facility is responsible for receiving and responding to messages from guests. Go to Settings> Employees and make sure the "Receive guest messages" checkbox is ticked
