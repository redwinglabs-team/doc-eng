# Online check-in

Online check-in allows guests to complete and sign registration cards in the Guest App and upload identity documents prior to arrival, reducing manual labor for staff and saving time. Registration cards completed during online check-in are automatically saved to relevant customer profiles in Quadro.

## How does it work?

As a rule, the "Online check-in" button is attached to the following types of email using the appropriate placeholder:

- User creation
- Confirmation of reservation
- Before departure

## Set up online check-in

The online check-in function does not require activation as the relative button is added to the emails by default

### Credit card registration for multiple charges

When a guest checks in online, authorization from the credit card holder (SCA) is required. We use 3D secure technology to authenticate credit card payments. After that, you can process payments on the fly, without requiring further checks from the guest again, reducing friction on both sides and improving payment approval rates.

!!! Note
    This feature is only available for owners of credit cards and facilities in the European Economic Area (EEA)

## Disable online check-in

If you don't want customers to be able to check in online, you can remove the login link from the placeholder of the following emails by editing the template:

- Confirmation of reservation
- Before departure
