# Cash desk

Cash management in PoP is a leaner but equally functional version of the version analyzed in FnB. You can create payment types, add terminals, configure payments, and access charge information.

The cash desk is divided into two macro sections: the Order and the Account in order to guarantee 360 ​​° payment management.

## Order

The order represents a summary of the balance sheet, but a difference in the account, has no tax implications or direct links to payments. The creation of an order is automatic every time the checkout is accessed.
