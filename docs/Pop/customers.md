## Create a user profile

Most of the users are automatically generated in PoP thanks to the integrations with the other systems of the hospitality suite such as Quadro PMS, FnB, etc., but it is also possible to manually create a user profile.

1. Go to Main Menu> Profiles> New User Profile
2. Fill in the relevant fields. Only the user's surname is required, but we recommend that you fill in the profile fields as much as possible.
