## Configuration of fiscal printers

Configure PoP printer profiles for each physical printer in your restaurant environment (eg Receipt, fiscal, kitchen or bar printers). If you have four unique printers in your restaurant, you should have four printers configured in Restaurant Manager.

Once printers are added to PoP, they can be linked to printer models so that particular types of print jobs are sent to the correct printer model.

Note that adding a physical printer to PoP also requires some hardware settings and network configurations.
