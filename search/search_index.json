The cash desk is divided into two macro sections: the Order and the Account in order to guarantee 360 \u200b\u200b\u00b0 payment management. Order The order represents a summary of the order, but unlike the account, it has no tax implications or direct links with payments. The creation of an order is automatic every time the checkout is accessed. Changes are allowed to the order such as: adding a dish, transferring it to the beam and vice versa and assigning it to a guest. Below we will analyze in detail the functions of an Order. Add a dish to your order Whether the order is empty (eg payment at the cashier for individual items) or contains an order for a table, it is possible to add one or more dishes from the restaurant menu. Go to Main Menu> Cashier or go to Main Menu> Spaces> Pay (selecting a table with active command) Select a Menu category Select a dish Enter the Quantity Click Create Menu items added directly to the checkout are automatically considered as \"Centerpieces\". If the order is empty, it is automatically sent to the kitchen for preparation. Delete an order Before paying for an order, you can modify it at will by eliminating the dishes it contains. If so, you can proceed with deleting the entire order. Go to Main Menu> Cashier Click on Delete Order Click Delete Adding a customer to an Order If an Order is being created directly from the cash desk, it is possible to assign it to a customer present in the database so as to historicize his order for reporting functions. Go to Main Menu> Cashier Click Add Customer Search for the customer or select them from the list Click Add Transfer Orders At the cashier you have the possibility to transfer an order in two options: you can transfer an order created at the cashier and assign it to a table, or you can select a table with an active order and transfer the order to the cashier. Transfer an order to the table Go to Main Menu> Cashier Add at least one item to the Order Click on Transfer Order From the room overview, select a free table Transfer an order to the cashier Go to Main Menu> Cashier Click on Map Tables From the room overview, select a table with an active command Print a pre account Before you can make a payment, you often need to provide a preview of the account to the guest. The pre-account print function provides for this requirement by printing an order summary without any fiscal value. Go to Main Menu> Cashier Create a new order or transfer an order from the room Click on Print before account Check the preview and click Print Pay for an order To be able to pay for an order and post it for tax purposes, you must access the Accounts section. There are two ways to do this. Full account payment Go to Main Menu> Cashier Create a new order or transfer an order from the room Click Pay Splitting an account Go to Main Menu> Cashier Create a new order or transfer an order from the room Click on Split Select the number of people to split the account into Click Confirm Note Splitting an order will create as many accounts as there are people entered Bill The bill represents the summary of the items that will have to be paid for. The payment of an account involves the printing of the relative receipt and the taxation of the transaction of the sold. Apply a discount Before paying a bill, you can apply a discount to the total cost of the items, including VAT.

The occupancy report is a schematic overview of all types of space, the number of spaces in each category, and the business on-the books for each type of space per day. The overview offers information on occupancy, availability and your nightly rates for each category of space. Reported data The report shows the occupancy and availability of each category of space per day. Each space category is listed with the total number of spaces in that category. For each day of the week, each space category is listed with: The total percentage of occupied spaces. The total amount of money charged for occupied spaces. A bar indicating employment. A black bar means that the space category has no direct overbooking on that date. If the space category has indirect overbooking, the bar will show the number of free spaces in that space category. An orange bar means that the space category has a direct overbook on that date. When a space category is overbooked, the number of free seats and spaces will be negative (corresponding to the number of overbookings). Hover over a block to view the following additional information: Spaces: Number of spaces in the selected category. Occupancy: Percentage of a category of space that is occupied on a given day. Busy: Number of spaces occupied on a given day. Indoor Uses: Number of spaces used for indoor use on a given day. Out of order: Number of spaces that are out of order on a given day Free Spaces: Number of spaces that are physically unoccupied. Direct Overbooking: Number of spaces on a given day that have been directly overbooked. Direct overbookings occur when the number of reservations assigned to a space category exceeds the number of spaces. Indirect overbooking: The number of spaces on a given day that have been indirectly overbooked - indirect overbooking occurs when another category of space has been overbooked, and excess bookings are reallocated (indirect - overbookings are used only for reporting purposes and do not affect the availability of the space category). Availability change: Changes to the number of spaces available within a space category on a given day. Availability: Number of spaces available on a given day. Arrivals: Number of spaces with guests arriving on a given day. Departures: Number of spaces with guests departing on a given day. Stay Overs: Number of spaces on a given day that have no guests arriving or departing. Customers: Total number of customers in the house on a given day. Extra beds: Number of extra beds reserved on a given day. Note The number of arrivals and departures indicated in the additional information refers to the number of seats with arriving or departing guests, so it will be different from the number of Arrivals and Departures on the Dashboard (which refers to the number of bookings arriving or departing).

Values: Choose by which values \u200b\u200byou want your space categories to be listed in a day. Gross: View your space categories listed with the total amount charged for occupied spaces. Net: Displays your space categories listed with the net amount (gross amount minus tax rate) paid for occupied spaces. Tax Value: View your space categories listed with the amount of tax applied for occupied spaces. Space Type: Refine your report results to specific types of space. Rate Mode: Choose how rates should be listed in the report. Average Night Rate: The average price for a space on a given night. Sales Rate: The cost at which you are selling a space on a given night.

If the space category has indirect overbooking, the bar will show the number of free spaces in that space category. An orange bar means that the space category has a direct overbook on that date. When a space category is overbooked, the number of free seats and spaces will be negative (corresponding to the number of overbookings). Hover over a block to view the following additional information: Spaces: Number of spaces in the selected category. Occupancy: Percentage of a category of space that is occupied on a given day. Busy: Number of spaces occupied on a given day. Indoor Uses: Number of spaces used for indoor use on a given day. Out of order: Number of spaces that are out of order on a given day Free Spaces: Number of spaces that are physically unoccupied. Direct Overbooking: Number of spaces on a given day that have been directly overbooked. Direct overbookings occur when the number of reservations assigned to a space category exceeds the number of spaces. Indirect overbooking: The number of spaces on a given day that have been indirectly overbooked - indirect overbooking occurs when another category of space has been overbooked, and excess bookings are reallocated (indirect - overbookings are used only for reporting purposes and do not affect the availability of the space category). Availability change: Changes to the number of spaces available within a space category on a given day. Availability: Number of spaces available on a given day. Arrivals: Number of spaces with guests arriving on a given day. Departures: Number of spaces with guests departing on a given day. Stay Overs: Number of spaces on a given day that have no guests arriving or departing. Customers: Total number of customers in the house on a given day. Extra beds: Number of extra beds reserved on a given day. Note The number of arrivals and departures indicated in the additional information refers to the number of seats with arriving or departing guests, so it will be different from the number of Arrivals and Departures on the Dashboard (which refers to the number of bookings arriving or departing).","title":"Reported data"},{"location":"Quadro/Distribution/occupancy/#filters","text":"Start: Select a start date to limit the results to a specific time period.

Functionality Operational hotspots A member of the management team should be available in all critical and busy operational hotspots. Facilities can often have a large number of arrivals or departures on the first day of the week. These hotspots are a key to making or breaking a customer experience. Use this report to highlight the most active days and times in your facility. Create your schedule using this report to ensure management is optimal, breaks are scheduled outside these windows and improve guest satisfaction by making yourself available when you need them most. Booking trends Often, when guests book at your property, they've already reviewed options and availability ahead of time and returned to finalize their bookings. Use this report to check trends or statistics. Filter the results to see what time or day of the week your guests book your property. If you see a specific trend, use this information to create targeted promotional material. For example, if you see a lot of bookings being made on Mondays, you could raise your rates that night to generate some extra revenue. Housekeeping application For most properties, the average cleaning shift starts at 08:00 and ends at 16:00. Therefore, in theory, the rooms are cleaned and inspected in the same order. However, using this report, you will find that most of the rooms are changed to be inspected between 3pm and 4pm. This means that housekeepers don't have the tools to communicate easily and quickly when they're done cleaning a room. This miscommunication often has a negative effect on guests, as rooms may be clean and ready, but guests are not yet able to check in before the official check-in time.","title":"Activity"},{"location":"Quadro/Report/activity/#activity","text":"","title":"Activity"},{"location":"Quadro/Report/activity/#activity-report","text":"To access the Activity report section go to Main Menu> Report> Activity The Activity Report is a great tool for analyzing your property's operations.

The Timeline is the graphical display of all bookings in a selected time period, organized primarily by room type and secondly by room number within that room type. On the Timeline you can zoom in or out, so you can see the Timeline with more or less data. This is useful not only for viewing more bookings simultaneously, but also for optimizing use on mobile devices. Below, you can find a detailed description of all the features, filters and data available on the Timeline and how to best use them. Reservation colors Yellow: Reservations that require action today. They are either bookings that need to be checked in or checked out by the end of today. Black: Reservations that are currently in the hotel and do not require any action within today. They are already checked in and have a check-out date that is on a date later than today. Blue: Reservations that are either in the past or future and do not overlap with today, thus not requiring any action within today. Gray: Reservations that are indicating out of order rooms. Once a room is placed out of order, it is no longer available for sale. House use bookings are also indicated in grey. Orange: Reservations that require urgent action, such as no shows or options that have expired. Dotted line: Reservations that have not yet been confirmed or reached their release date. Housekeeping status colors Dark green: Inspected room Grey: Out of service room Red: Dirty room Black: Out of order room Green: Clean room Yellow: Cleaning in progress room Filters At the top of the Timeline there are some different filters: Arrows: Double arrows move the history forward or back by one month. Single arrows move the history forward or back by one week Today: This button will always take you to today's date, which will always be highlighted Select Date: Use this date picker to quickly jump to a specific date Select space: Search by name of space categories or by room number in order to display the spaces with the corresponding criteria in the drop-down menu. Reservation for internal use: ?? Spaces The far left column of the Timeline contains a list of your space categories. As you zoom back and forth, you may notice that Short Names are often used in this case, as space becomes limited. Within each of these space categories, you will see all corresponding names or space numbers, each with its own row. If any spaces contain other spaces, you will see that the one represented as each subsequent space will also have its own line on the Timeline. All space numbers are clickable and form a direct link to the corresponding space structure page for each of them. The space structure page for each of them contains all the details regarding the status of that space. From this screen, you can quickly change the room status to Dirty, Clean, Ready for Check In, Temporarily Out of Service, or Out of Use. You can also find a summary of all recent blocks Under Repair and all recent space status changes. Space numbers are also displayed in the corresponding space state color for easy identification. Reservations Reservations appear as blocks on the Timeline, which occupy a period of time corresponding to the duration of the reservation. The space blocks in the Timeline all accurately represent both the arrival and departure times for each booking and are always displayed in the appropriate action color. Each reservation is displayed with the name of the reservation owner in Last Name, First Name format. If the customer has been assigned any of the Customer Ratings, you will also see the corresponding icons immediately after the customer name. You may also find a Padlock icon displayed before the customer name, which is described in more detail below. When you click on a reservation, a window opens with the reservation details. From this screen you can select the Manage or Group buttons to open the Reservation Form, or use the applicable action button to Check in or Check out that reservation. Within Simple Detail, you can click on the icon next to the guest's name for a direct link to the customer's profile, where you can manage your personal data as needed. Move Click, drag and drop unlocked booking blocks to move them to the Timeline. You can use this method to upgrade reservations to a higher space category. Once a booking has been dragged to a higher category, an Up Arrow icon will appear on the booking block in front of the customer's name, indicating that the booking has been upgraded to a higher category. The Timeline does not allow reservations to be downgraded to a lower category using drag and drop, which is useful for preventing accidental downgrades. If an unlocked booking block is moved and then dropped onto another, the system will automatically try to reassign the booking that was previously in that slot. If there is no other suitable room, the reservation will be placed in an overbooked place. Once a reservation is placed in the overbook slot, it must be manually moved to a suitable room assignment. For more information on overbooking, see below. Lock or unlock When you select a booking on the Timeline, all booking information will appear in the Simple Detail window on the right. Within this window is the Padlock icon, which can be used to lock or unlock this reservation from modification. Blocking the reservation means that the reservation can no longer be moved. Padlocks are mainly used to prevent employees from accidentally moving reservations. Properties may want to block a reservation for various reasons, for example, a returning guest may have specifically requested the assigned seat. Reservations will be automatically unlocked by the system only if the arrival or departure dates are changed. Therefore, please note that after changing these booking details, the user must block the booking again to prevent it from being moved. Overbooking When new reservations are created, they are automatically assigned to a space on the Timeline. If a facility has overbooked a category, i.e. it has created more bookings than the number of seats available, the system will automatically create overbooking slots in which to place the booking until the property is able to resolve the conflict. These slots are displayed in red, indicating that urgent action is needed, and are used as a temporary placeholder for reservations that have not yet been moved to an available space. You can resolve the overbooking by moving the reservation block from the overbooking slot to a free space, which will automatically remove the overbooking slot from the Timeline.","title":"Timeline"},{"location":"Quadro/Reservations/timeline/#timeline","text":"To view the history of all reservations, go to Main Menu> Reservations> Timeline.
